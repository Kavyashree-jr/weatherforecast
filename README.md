# weatherforecast
Developed a web-based Weather Forecasting application using HTML and CSS for the front end, and Flask  integrated with the OpenWeatherMap API for the back end. Utilized VS Code for development and tested  across various web browsers on both Windows and Linux operating systems, with PHP compatibility for server side support.
